            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Beginning with Drupal 8 a new
                utility class was <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Component!Utility!Xss.php/class/Xss" target="_blank">introduced</a> that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                XSS attacks are a common type of security vulnerability that occur when an attacker is able to inject
                malicious code into a website, which is then executed by the browser of any user who visits the affected
                site. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information or
                redirecting users to a different site.
            </p>

            <p>
            To help protect against XSS attacks, Drupal 10 includes a new utility class called "Xss" that provides a set
            of methods for sanitizing user-supplied input. This class can be used to filter out potentially dangerous
            characters and tags from user input, making it much harder for attackers to inject malicious code into a
            website.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the key features of the Xss class is its ability to automatically detect and remove potentially
                dangerous input. This is done by using a combination of regular expressions and a whitelist of allowed
                characters and tags. By default, the class will only allow a small set of safe HTML tags, such as "p"
                and "a", and will remove any other tags or attributes that could be used to inject malicious code.
            </p>
            The Xss class also includes a number of other methods for sanitizing input, including methods for removing
            JavaScript and other types of code, as well as methods for encoding special characters to prevent them from
            being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.

            <p>
                Using the Xss class is simple, and can be done by calling the class's methods on user-supplied input
                before displaying it on a website. This helps to ensure that only safe, sanitized input is displayed to
                users, making it much harder for attackers to inject malicious code. Examples of how to use the Xss class in the next section.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>Next we will go over some examples on how to use the XSS class.</p>

            <h4>Xss:filter</h4>
            <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchadmandoo%2Fchadmandoo.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fcode_samples%2Fxss_utility%2Fxss_utility_basic.php&style=github-dark-dimmed&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>
            <p>
            In this example, we first import the Xss class using the "use" statement. Then we get the user-supplied input from a form using the $_POST variable. We then pass this input to the Xss::filter method, which automatically detects and removes potentially dangerous characters and tags. Finally, we display the sanitized input on the website using the echo statement.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Xss::filter method is the most basic method provided by the Xss class, it is recommended to use it for most cases.
            </p>

            <h4>Xss:filterAdmin()</h4>
            <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchadmandoo%2Fchadmandoo.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fcode_samples%2Fxss_utility%2Fxss_utility_filter_admin.php&style=github-dark-dimmed&type=code&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showFullPath=on&showCopy=on"></script>
            <p>This method is similar to the Xss::filter method, but it allows a broader set of HTML tags and attributes, which are considered safe for use in administrative interfaces. The list of admin tags that can be used is accessible either through the API documentation website or by invoking the Xss:getAdminTagList() method.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, Drupal 10's new Xss utility class is an important addition that helps protect against
                cross-site scripting attacks. By providing a set of methods for sanitizing user-supplied input, it makes
                it much harder for attackers to inject malicious code into a website. This is a important step towards
                making Drupal more secure and is a recommended best practice for any Drupal site.
